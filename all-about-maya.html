    <h1 class="heading">All about Mayan Civilization</h1>
    <p>
      The Mayan civilization was one of the greatest civilizations in history.
      It lasted almost 3000 years, from 2000 BC to 1524 AD. Historians divided it
      into three different periods:
    </p>

    <h2 class="tbl_title">Time Periods of the Mayan Civilization:</h2>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Pre-Classical Period</th>
        <th>Classical Period</th>
        <th>Post-Classical Period</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>1500 BC - 250 AD</td>
        <td>250 AD - 900 AD</td>
        <td>900 AD - Early 1500s</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <h3 class="pc_maya_head">Pre-Classical Period:</h3>
    <p class="pc_maya_des">
      The Preclassic period in Maya history stretches from the beginning of
      permanent village life around 1000 BC until the advent of the Classic Period
      around 250 AD. The period is subdivided into Early (prior to 1000 BC), Middle
      (1000–400 BC), and Late (400 BC – 250 AD). Major archaeological sites of this
      period include Nakbe, Uaxactun, Seibal, San Bartolo, Cival, and El Mirador.
    </p>

    <p class="pc_maya_des">
      Maya society underwent a series of profound transformations between
      approximately 100 AD and 250 AD, which resulted in the cessation of monumental
      building at many Preclassic cities and the inferred collapse of their political
      and economic systems, often characterized as the "Preclassic Collapse."

    <h2 class="pc_maya_col_head">Collapse of Pre-Classical Maya:</h2>
    <p class="pc_maya_col_des">
      The "Preclassic collapse" refers to the systematic decline and abandonment
      of the major Preclassic cities such as El Mirador around 100 AD. A number of
      theories have been proposed to explain this collapse, but there is little
      consensus on the causes, similar to the more famous Classic Maya collapse.

    <h2 class="pc_maya_cul">Culture of Pre-Classical Maya:</h2>

    <h2 class="pc_maya_ss_head">Social Structure:</h2>
    <p class="pc_maya_ss_des">
      The archaeological site of Kʼo, associated with the Classic Maya city of
      Holmul located in modern-day Guatemala, boasts what may be the royal tomb of
      the earliest known Maya ruler. This tomb has been dated to 350–300 BC and
      contains the earliest evidence of the institution of ajaw (ruler) in the Maya
      Lowlands.
    </p>

    <h2 class="pc_maya_aa_head">Art and Architecture:</h2>
    <p class="pc_maya_aa_des">
      Early Maya architecture is based on the general Mesoamerican architectural
      traditions. The stepped pyramids were constructed from the Terminal Pre-classic
      period onwards.
    </p>

    <p class="pc_maya_aa_des">
      In 2010, archaeologists at Chiapa de Corzo, southern Chiapas, Mexico,
      announced they found a dignitary's tomb inside a pyramid that may be the oldest
      type of burial discovered in Mesoamerica. The grave dates from about 2,700
      years ago.
